# Master-Thesis

## Medical Image Super-Resolution
* My masterâ€™s thesis, titled **Quantitative Analysis of Super-Resolution on Medical Image Pathology** was
conducted during my master's at IIT Jammu, under the supervision of Prof. Harkeerat Kaur and Prof. Bakul Goel.
* In this research, various super-resolution models, including **SRCNN, ESPCN, SRGAN, WDSR, and EDSR** were
implemented on diverse medical image datasets of different modalities. The study involved a quantitative analysis of the
results using various quality assessment metrics, such as **RMSE, PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, SCC, and VIFP** specifically
focusing on normal and diseased images, separately evaluating the quality degradation within the disease regions. The
hypothesis was subsequently validated using the Mann-Whitney U Test
